* Introduction
  The =more-conditions= system contains some condition classes and
  helper functions which may be useful when building slightly complex
  systems.

  One aspect handled by these classes is "chaining" of
  conditions. Chaining is one way to implement signaling and handling
  of conditions in a layered architecture: layers handle (not
  necessarily in the sense of unwinding the stack and transferring
  control) conditions signaled from lower layers by wrapping them in
  an appropriate condition class and re-signaling. Support for this
  pattern is provided by the following classes and functions:
  + =chainable-condition=
  + =cause= and =root-cause=
  + =maybe-print-cause=
  
  Another aspect are custom simple conditions. The function
  =maybe-print-explanation= is intended to make writing report
  functions for custom simple conditions easier.

  Finally, =more-conditions= provides a couple of specific
  =program-error= s:
  + =program-error=
    + =missing-required-argument=
      + =missing-required-initarg=
    + =incompatible-arguments=
      + =incompatible-initargs=
    + =initarg-error=
      + =missing-required-initarg=
      + =incompatible-initargs=
