(cl:in-package #:more-conditions)

(defmacro with-condition-translation (clauses &body body)
  "Execute BODY translating conditions as specified by CLAUSES when
they are signaled.

CLAUSES is a list of clauses of the form

  ((FROM-CONDITION TO-CONDITION
    &key
    var
    cause-initarg
    signal-via
    muffle?)
   INITARG1 VALUE1
   INITARG2 VALUE2
   ...)

FROM-CONDITION specifies a condition type (as e.g. in
`cl:handler-bind') instances of which should be translated to
instances of the condition class designated by TO-CONDITION.

The instance of TO-CONDITIONS is signaled via the value
of :SIGNAL-VIA (default is `cl:error') and receives the initargs
INITARG1 VALUE1, INITARG2 VALUE2, ... and the value of :CAUSE-INITARG
\(default is :CAUSE) with the original condition instance as its
value. When the value of :CAUSE-INITARG is nil, the original condition
is not passed to the constructed condition instance.

If supplied, the value of :VAR names a variable in which the original
condition instance should be received.

MUFFLE? controls whether the original condition should be muffled
after the translation has been performed. \(This is useful for
`cl:warning's and generic `cl:condition's which would not get handled
by resignaling via e.g. `cl:warn').  "
